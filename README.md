## Notes

Some challenges throughout the process of making this app was understanding the DOM and how to properly put in and modify objects in a way that will quarantee the outcome I wanted. For example, having placed the image component for the games in the wrong area made it leave the parent components area and didn't look right. I was able to fix it and would come across similar issues throughout the process.
